# CCCD
*C Code Cheat Detection*

THIS PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING YET.
DO NOT TRY TO USE IT IN PRODUCTION.

This software aims to detect C code similarity.
It should do it by :
- Considering C code meaning, after preprocessing.
- Filtering out frills.
- Match linse of a same scope regardless of their order
- Match scopes of a same scope regardless of their order.
- Increasing cheat score by having lines in the same order, regardless lines between them.
- Increasing score in case of similar names for structures, functions or variables.
